# wp-foundation-sites

This is a very bare-bones WordPress theme built with [Foundation Sites 6](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites.html). It includes no WordPress features. It's a starting point for theme developers that want to use Foundation and build every WordPress feature themselves. If you want a more featureful starting point, I recommend @JeremyEnglert's [JointsWP](https://github.com/JeremyEnglert/JointsWP/).

## Requirements

* NPM
* Bower
* Gulp

## Setup

* Download or clone the repo
* Run `npm install` to get node_modules
* Run `bower install` to get bower_components
* Run `gulp` to compile the CSS & JavaScript

## Making changes

Run `gulp watch` to watch for changes to `.sass` and `.js` files

#### CSS

* Add your custom styles to `assets/scss/app.scss`
* Change the Foundation variables in `assets/scss/_settings.scss`
* Choose which Foundation component styles you want in `assets/scss/foundation.scss`

#### JavaScript

* Do not edit the files in `assets/js/` -- they're generated by Gulp
* Add/edit your custom JavaScript files in `assets/js/scripts/`
* All `.js` files in `assets/js/scripts/` will concatenate to `assets/js/scripts.js` and `assets/js/scripts.min.js`

## Upgrading

* When upgrading to a newer version of Foundation, make sure `assets/scss/_settings.scss` uses `@import '../../bower_components/foundation-sites/scss/util/util';` not `@import 'util/util';`.
